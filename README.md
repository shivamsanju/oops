# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Design Patterns

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Object-Oriented Programming is a paradigm that structures software design around real-world entities, encapsulating data and behavior within objects. OOP principles include:

- **Encapsulation:** Bundling data and methods that operate on that data into a single unit, known as a class.
- **Inheritance:** Creating new classes by inheriting properties and behaviors from existing classes.
- **Polymorphism:** Allowing objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common type, enabling flexibility and extensibility.

- **Abstraction:** Representing essential features while hiding unnecessary details.

## Design Patterns

Design Patterns are reusable solutions to common problems encountered in software design. They provide a template for solving issues and help in creating maintainable and scalable software. Some popular design patterns include:

### Singleton Pattern

Ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

### Factory Pattern

Defines an interface for creating an object but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

### Observer Pattern

Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

### Strategy Pattern

Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each algorithm, and makes them interchangeable. It allows the client to choose the appropriate algorithm at runtime.

### Decorator Pattern

Attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically, providing a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

### Command Pattern

Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby parameterizing clients with queues, requests, and operations.

### MVC Pattern (Model-View-Controller)

Separates the application logic into three interconnected components - Model (data and business logic), View (user interface), and Controller (handles user input).

These design patterns contribute to building maintainable, scalable, and flexible software systems.
